bugs
----

- the LivePlot currently seems rather unreliable
    - this may be a recently introduced bug from matplotlib itself
    - may need to open an issue upstream if it isn't my fault
    related:
        - current calls to matplotlib api (LivePlot, EvaluationFrame.plot) are messy

refactoring
-----------

- refactor state management in the test handler (is_running, is_done....)
- refactor TestHandlerView
    - see above -- probably better to just brute force with calls to build than to do all
    the current tkVar tracing sillyness
- we have a dep. on Pandas for one little call in export_csv -- could be worked around

updates / new features
----------------------

- menubar:
    - 'add system' -> 'system' > 'add new', 'remove current'
- refactor scoring out of eval window -- deserves its own helper func

low prio
--------

- port over the old chlorides / ppm calculators
