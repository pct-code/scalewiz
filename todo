#2 entry validation in project info (filename chars)
#4 support for program settings stored in TOML or similar
#5 don't do this
#6 entry validation in experiment params (ints/doubles)
#7 refactor state management in the test handler


don't allow a project to be loaded to more than one system
    OR allow it but ensure data loss can't occur
entry validation 
??? remove last three tabs of evaluation window?
'add system' -> 'system' > 'add new', 'remove current'
anything called 'Report as' either in code or UI should be renamed to something like 'label'
