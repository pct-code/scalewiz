bugs
----

- no bugs! i think

done

- the LivePlot currently seems rather unreliable
    - this may be a recently introduced bug from matplotlib itself
    - may need to open an issue upstream if it isn't my fault
    related:
        - current calls to matplotlib api (EvaluationWindow.plot) are messy

refactoring
-----------

- eval window only needs plot calls fixed to OOP style now

done

- TestHandlerView refactor is pretty much done
    - [fixed?] the LivePlot seems to not get rebuilt after a test ends
    - [fixed?] we still need to disable all the entries while a test is running

- we have a dep. on Pandas for one little call in export_csv -- could be worked around

updates / new features
----------------------

- menubar:
    - 'add system' -> 'system' > 'add new', 'remove current'
    - this will be a little awkward since we'd have to update/rebuild the menubar
    each time a system is added / removed

low prio
--------

- port over the old chlorides / ppm calculators
- check for config missing keys ?
- check the start button disabling
- color cycle for config / projects
- the score function could be hooked up to poll from a logging queue, perhaps overkill
