todo
----

- new screenshots of eval window / plot for docs

bugs
----

refactoring
-----------

- we have a dep. on Pandas for one little call in export_csv -- could be worked around

updates / new features
----------------------

- menubar:
    - 'add system' -> 'system' > 'add new', 'remove current'
    - this will be a little awkward since we'd have to update/rebuild the menubar
    each time a system is added / removed

low prio
--------

- port over the old chlorides / ppm calculators
- check for config missing keys ?
- color cycle for config / projects
- the score function could be hooked up to poll from a logging queue, perhaps overkill
