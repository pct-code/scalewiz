bugs
----


done

- the LivePlot currently seems rather unreliable
    - this may be a recently introduced bug from matplotlib itself
    - may need to open an issue upstream if it isn't my fault
    related:
        - current calls to matplotlib api (LivePlot.plot, EvaluationFrame.plot) are messy

refactoring
-----------

done
~~~~

- (mostly done) the way the EvaluationWindow is rendered makes my itchy and must change


- TestHandlerView refactor is pretty much done
    - the LivePlot seems to not get rebuilt after a test ends
    - we still need to disable all the entries while a test is running

- we have a dep. on Pandas for one little call in export_csv -- could be worked around

updates / new features
----------------------

- menubar:
    - 'add system' -> 'system' > 'add new', 'remove current'
    - this will be a little awkward since we'd have to update/rebuild the menubar
    each time a system is added / removed
- refactor scoring out of eval window -- deserves its own helper func

low prio
--------

- port over the old chlorides / ppm calculators
