todo
----

- try to clean up export code / add export confirmation dialog
- handle a queue of changes to a project more gracefully
- try to clean up export code / VBA import code


bugs
----

- none! I'm pretty sure ...

refactoring
-----------

- we have a dep. on Pandas for one little call in export helper - could be worked around

updates / new features
----------------------

- none!

low prio
--------

- port over the old chlorides / ppm calculators
- check for config missing keys ?
- menubar:
    - 'add system' -> 'system' > 'add new', 'remove current'
    - this will be a little awkward since we'd have to update/rebuild the menubar
    each time a system is added / removed
